Hi elmesito,
I am sorry that I am contacting you using a pull request, but this is the only way for me to contact you :(. I saw your answer about the way you simulated capacitive touch when you were working in touch screen development (link: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/423740/simulate-capacitive-touch). I am looking for a solution to simulate a capacitive touch and I am willing to pay more than $10000 USD for this. If you are interested in providing me with the solution (or part of the solution), we can have a discussion via email. My email address is zjx6983@gmail.com. I am looking forward to your reply :).

Sorry again for contacting you using a pull request.

Best,
Jason
